# Grocery List Taking App using Firebase DB

## How to Use

1. Enter the grocery item that you want to note and click the save button under the input box.
2. The entered item will be displayed under the save button.
3. After purchasing, select the item from the entered grocery list to delete it from the database.
4. You can use the same app in many devices simultaneously but deleting/adding item in one device affects other devices using the app at the same time because the data entered/deleted are updated in the firebase in real-time.
